    <p class="lyrics">So close no matter how far
        Couldn't be much more from the heart
        Forever trusting who we are
        And nothing else matters
        
        Never opened myself this way
        Life is ours, we live it our way
        All these words I don't just say
        And nothing else matters
        
        Trust I seek and I find in you
        Every day for us something new
        Open mind for a different view
        And nothing else matters
        
        Never cared for what they do
        Never cared for what they know
        But I know
        
        So close no matter how far
        Couldn't be much more from the heart
        Forever trusting who we are
        And nothing else matters
        
        Never cared for what they do
        Never cared for what they know
        But I know
        
        I never opened myself this way
        Life is ours, we live it our way
        All these words I don't just say
        And nothing else matters
        
        Trust I seek and I find in you
        Every day for us something new
        Open mind for a different view
        And nothing else matters
        
        Never cared for what they say
        Never cared for games they play
        Never cared for what they do
        Never cared for what they know
        And I know
        
        So close no matter how far
        Couldn't be much more from the heart
        Forever trusting who we are
        No nothing else matters
