    <p class="lyrics">Lay beside me and tell me what they've done
      <br>
      And speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
      <br>
      The door is locked now but it's open if you're true
      <br>
      If you can understand the me then I can understand the you
      <br>
      <br>
      Lay beside me, under wicked sky
      <br>
      Through black of day, dark of night, we share this, paralyzed
      <br>
      The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
      <br>
      Black heart scarring darker still but there's no sun shining through
      <br>
      No there's no sun shining through, no there's no sun shining
      <br>
      <br>
      What I've felt, what I've known
      <br>
      Turn the pages, turn the stone
      <br>
      Behind the door, should I open it for you?
      <br>
      <br>
      Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
      <br>
      Sick and tired, I stand alone
      <br>
      Could you be there
      <br>
      'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
      <br>
      Or are you unforgiven too?
      <br>
      <br>
      Come lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear
      <br>
      She loves me not, she loves me still but she'll never love again
      <br>
      She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
      <br>
      Black hearts scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
      <br>
      Yes she'll be there when I'm gone, dead sure she'll be there?
      <br>
      <br>
      What I've felt, what I've known
      <br>
      Turn the pages, turn the stone
      <br>
      Behind the door, should I open it for you?
      <br>
      <br>
      Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
      <br>
      Sick and tired, I stand alone
      <br>
      Could you be there
      <br>
      'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
      <br>
      Or are you unforgiven too?
      <br>
      <br>
      Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
      <br>
      The door is closed so are your eyes
      <br>
      But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
      <br>
      <br>
      Yes now I see it
      <br>
      What I've felt, what I've known
      <br>
      Turn the pages, turn the stone
      <br>
      Behind the door, should I open it for you
      <br>
      <br>
      Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
      <br>
      So sick and tired, I stand alone
      <br>
      Could you be there
      <br>
      'Cause I'm the one who waits
      <br>
      The one who waits for you
      <br>
      <br>
      Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
      <br>
      Turn the pages, turn the stone
      <br>
      Behind the door, should I open it for you? (so I dub thee unforgiven)
      <br>
      <br>
      Oh, what I've felt
      <br>
      Oh, what I've known
      <br>
      I'll take this key and I'll bury it in you
      <br>
      Because you're unforgiven too
      <br>
      <br>
      Never free, never me
      <br>
      'Cause you're unforgiven too, oh oh</p>
