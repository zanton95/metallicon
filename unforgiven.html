    <h1 class="unforgiven-title">Unforgiven</h1>
    <p class="unforgiven-song">New blood joins this earth
        And quickly he's subdued
        Through constant pain disgrace
        The young boy learns their rules
        With time the child draws in
        This whipping boy done wrong
        Deprived of all his thoughts
        The young man struggles on and on he's known
        A vow unto his own
        That never from this day
        His will they'll take away
        What I've felt
        What I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never be
        Never see
        Won't see what might have been
        What I've felt
        What I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never free
        Never me
        So I dub thee unforgiven
        They dedicate their lives
        To running all of his
        He tries to please them all
        This bitter man he is
        Throughout his life the same
        He's battled constantly
        This fight he cannot win
        A tired man they see no longer cares
        The old man then prepares
        To die regretfully
        That old man here is me
        What I've felt
        What I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never be
        Never see
        Won't see what might have been
        What I've felt
        What I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never free
        Never me
        So I dub thee unforgiven
        What I've felt
        What I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never be
        Never see
        Won't see what might have been
        What I've felt
        What I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown
        Never free
        Never me
        So I dub thee unforgiven
        Never free
        Never me
        So I dub thee unforgiven
        You labeled me
        I labeled you
        So I dub thee unforgiven
        Never free
        Never me
        So I dub thee unforgiven
        You labeled me
        I labeled you
        So I dub thee unforgiven
        Never free
        Never me
        So I dub thee unforgiven</p>
