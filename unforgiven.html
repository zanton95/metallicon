    <p class="lyrics">Lay beside me and tell me what they've done
      \r
      And speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
      \r
      The door is locked now but it's open if you're true
      \r
      If you can understand the me then I can understand the you
      \r
      \r
      Lay beside me, under wicked sky
      \r
      Through black of day, dark of night, we share this, paralyzed
      \r
      The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
      \r
      Black heart scarring darker still but there's no sun shining through
      \r
      No there's no sun shining through, no there's no sun shining
      \r
      \r
      What I've felt, what I've known
      \r
      Turn the pages, turn the stone
      \r
      Behind the door, should I open it for you?
      \r
      \r
      Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
      \r
      Sick and tired, I stand alone
      \r
      Could you be there
      \r
      'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
      \r
      Or are you unforgiven too?
      \r
      \r
      Come lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear
      \r
      She loves me not, she loves me still but she'll never love again
      \r
      She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
      \r
      Black hearts scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
      \r
      Yes she'll be there when I'm gone, dead sure she'll be there?
      \r
      \r
      What I've felt, what I've known
      \r
      Turn the pages, turn the stone
      \r
      Behind the door, should I open it for you?
      \r
      \r
      Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
      \r
      Sick and tired, I stand alone
      \r
      Could you be there
      \r
      'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
      \r
      Or are you unforgiven too?
      \r
      \r
      Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
      \r
      The door is closed so are your eyes
      \r
      But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
      \r
      \r
      Yes now I see it
      \r
      What I've felt, what I've known
      \r
      Turn the pages, turn the stone
      \r
      Behind the door, should I open it for you
      \r
      \r
      Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
      \r
      So sick and tired, I stand alone
      \r
      Could you be there
      \r
      'Cause I'm the one who waits
      \r
      The one who waits for you
      \r
      \r
      Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
      \r
      Turn the pages, turn the stone
      \r
      Behind the door, should I open it for you? (so I dub thee unforgiven)
      \r
      \r
      Oh, what I've felt
      \r
      Oh, what I've known
      \r
      I'll take this key and I'll bury it in you
      \r
      Because you're unforgiven too
      \r
      \r
      Never free, never me
      \r
      'Cause you're unforgiven too, oh oh</p>
