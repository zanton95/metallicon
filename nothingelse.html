      <br>
        Couldn't be much more from the heart
        <br>
        Forever trusting who we are
        <br>
        And nothing else matters
        <br>
        <br>
        Never opened myself this way

        Life is ours, we live it our way
        <br>
        All these words I don't just say
        <br>
        And nothing else matters
        <br>
        <br>
        Trust I seek and I find in you
        <br>
        Every day for us something new
        <br>
        Open mind for a different view
        <br>
        And nothing else matters
        <br>
        <br>
        Never cared for what they do

        Never cared for what they know
